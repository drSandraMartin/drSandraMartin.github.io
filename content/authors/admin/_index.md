## Welcome
<font color="white">I am a cognitive neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. I combine neuroimaging and neuromodulation methods with graph theory, large language models (LLMs), and behavioral modeling to explore cognitive changes across the adult lifespan.
{style="text-align: justify;"}  

I am particularly interested in the age-related changes in the trajectories of memory processes and their interaction with executive functions. I am also a strong supporter of open and reproducible research practices and strive to implement them in my own work.
