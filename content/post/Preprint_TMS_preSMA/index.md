title: ðŸ“š New preprint on the roles of left IFG and pre-SMA in semantic and executive control
summary: We have a new preprint out where we investigated the causal contributions of two key regions of cognitive control":" the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) in the medial frontal gyrus using TMS.

In this study, we investigated the causal contributions of two key regions of cognitive control: the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) in the medial frontal gyrus using TMS. Across four sessions, 24 participants received 1 Hz repetitive TMS to each region individually, dual-site TMS targeting both regions sequentially (IFG followed by pre-SMA), and sham TMS. Participants then completed semantic fluency, figural fluency, and picture-naming tasks.

The results nicely reveal domain-general processes of cognitive control shared between left IFG and pre-SMA and a region-specific contribution of the left IFG to semantic control. Using (generalized) linear mixed-effects regression and post-hoc modeling of the electric fields induced by TMS, we also provide unique evidence for successful compensation of executive functions through either the left IFG or pre-SMA.
