**Unlocking the Brain's Semantic Integration: New Insights from Our fMRI Study**. 

Proud to share our new Communications Biology paper revealing a two-part control system for flexible thinking: left IFG fine-tunes meaning, while pre-SMA drives domain‑general control across tasks.

By causally perturbing each region during semantic and executive fluency, we show shared involvement but distinct specializations—IFG leans semantic, pre‑SMA leans executive—highlighting a resilient, distributed network.
