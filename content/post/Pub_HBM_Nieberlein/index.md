**Unlocking the Brain's Semantic Integration: New Insights from Our fMRI Study**
In our latest research, we delve into the brain's ability to integrate semantic information, a cornerstone of effective communication. We tested 32 participants aged 30-75 using fMRI, uncovering how sentences with varying predictability influence brain activity and network interactions. We discovered that higher semantic integration demands lead to increased activity in the left frontal and temporal regions and emphasize the role of task-positive and default mode networks. These findings enhance our understanding of semantic processing across the lifespan and pave the way for future research in both healthy and clinical populations.
