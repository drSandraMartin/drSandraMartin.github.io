This May, I had the pleasure of being invited to Ghent for the third time to teach an intensive seminar on mixed-effects models in the Master course of EMCL. I really enjoy statistics, and teaching it is truly amazing, especially seeing how quickly people grasp the concepts and apply them to their own and example datasets. I'm looking forward to potentially returning to Ghent University for a fourth time!
