I was invited for a talk at the annual meeting of the German Aphasia Society (GAB). I presented recent results on the neural basis of semantic control. We use voxel- and disconnectome-mapping in chronic aphasia to disentangle the role of frontal and temporal regions in semantic control. Stay tuned for a preprint coming soon!
