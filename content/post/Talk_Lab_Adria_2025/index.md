This autumn, I had the chance to share my research at several events: the Berlin Neuroscience Meeting, the Language Testing and Brain Surgery Lab at the University of Groningen (led by Adrià Rofes), and the Linguistics in Verona (LiVe) meeting.  

It was great to exchange ideas and receive thoughtful feedback while presenting new results from my work on executive control in language processing across the adult lifespan.
