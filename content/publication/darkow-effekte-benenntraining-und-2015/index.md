abstract: Since the introduction of the international classification of functioning,
  disability and health, there has been a controversy as to whether more traditional
  or participation-oriented therapy approaches should be used in the treatment of
  aphasia patients. In this pilot study, we■■ the effects of a naming treatment and
  a newly developed discourse-treatment on connected speech in daily life. During
  both treatments, transcranial direct current stimulation was administered. Although
  this adjuvant therapy is still under evaluation, it is thought to facilitate therapy
  outcome. After both treatment approaches, the participant ­showed significant changes
  in his spontaneous speech. While lexical parameters of connected speech showed significant
  changes after naming therapy, the discourse training let to numerical changes in
  syntactic parameters. In the present single case both approaches demonstrated their
  efficacy.
