abstract: Semantic knowledge is central to human cognition. The angular gyrus (AG)
  is widely considered a key brain region for semantic cognition. However, the role
  of the AG in semantic processing is controversial. Key controversies concern response
  polarity (activation vs. deactivation) and its relation to task difficulty, lateralization
  (left vs. right AG), and functional--anatomical subdivision (PGa vs. PGp subregions).
  Here, we combined the fMRI data of five studies on semantic processing (n,=,172)
  and analyzed the response profiles from the same anatomical regions-of-interest
  for left and right PGa and PGp. We found that the AG was consistently deactivated
  during non-semantic conditions, whereas response polarity during semantic conditions
  was inconsistent. However, the AG consistently showed relative response differences
  between semantic and non-semantic conditions, and between different semantic conditions.
  A combined analysis across all studies revealed that AG responses could be best
  explained by separable effects of task difficulty and semantic processing demand.
  Task difficulty effects were stronger in PGa than PGp, regardless of hemisphere.
  Semantic effects were stronger in left than right AG, regardless of subregion. These
  results suggest that the AG is engaged in both domain-general task-difficulty-related
  processes and domain-specific semantic processes. In semantic processing, we propose
  that left AG acts as a ``multimodal convergence zone'' that binds different semantic
  features associated with the same concept, enabling efficient access to task-relevant
  features.
