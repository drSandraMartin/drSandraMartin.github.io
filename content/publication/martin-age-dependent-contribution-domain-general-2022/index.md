abstract: 'Aging is characterized by a decline of cognitive control. In semantic cognition,
  this leads to the paradox that older adults usually show poorer task performance
  than young adults despite their greater semantic knowledge. So far, the underlying
  neural changes of these behavioral differences are poorly understood. In the current
  neuroimaging study, we investigated the interaction of domain-specific and domain-general
  networks during verbal semantic fluency in young and older adults. Across age groups,
  task processing was characterized by a strong positive integration within the multiple-demand
  as well as between the multiple-demand and the default mode network during semantic
  fluency. However, the behavioral relevance of strengthened connectivity differed
  between groups: While within-network functional connectivity in both networks predicted
  greater efficiency in semantic fluency in young adults, it was associated with slower
  performance in older adults. Moreover, only young adults profited from connectivity
  between networks for their semantic memory performance. Our results suggest that
  the functional coupling of usually anticorrelated networks is critical for successful
  task processing, independent of age, when access to semantic memory is required.
  Furthermore, our findings lend novel support to the notion of reduced efficiency
  in the aging brain due to neural dedifferentiation in semantic cognition.'
