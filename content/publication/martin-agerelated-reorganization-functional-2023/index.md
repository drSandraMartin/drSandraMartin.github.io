abstract: Cognitive aging is associated with widespread neural reorganization processes
  in the human brain. However, the behavioral impact of such reorganization is not
  well understood. The current neuroimaging study investigated age differences in
  the functional network architecture during semantic word retrieval in young and
  older adults. Combining task-based functional connectivity, graph theory and cognitive
  measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, our findings show age-accompanied
  large-scale network reorganization even when older adults have intact word retrieval
  abilities. In particular, functional networks of older adults were characterized
  by reduced decoupling between systems, reduced segregation and efficiency, and a
  larger number of hub regions relative to young adults. Exploring the predictive
  utility of these age-related changes in network topology revealed high, albeit less
  efficient, performance for older adults whose brain graphs showed stronger dedifferentiation
  and reduced distinctiveness. Our results extend theoretical accounts on neurocognitive
  aging by revealing the compensational potential of the commonly reported pattern
  of network dedifferentiation when older adults can rely on their prior knowledge
  for successful task processing. However, we also demonstrate the limitations of
  such compensatory reorganization and show that a youth-like network architecture
  in terms of balanced integration and segregation is associated with more economical
  processing.
