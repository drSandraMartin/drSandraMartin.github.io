We wrote an invited commentary on an overview paper by Billot & Kiran (Brain & Language, 2024), in which they discuss the role of homeostasis and Hebbian plasticity in aphasia recovery. We discuss the framework and outline potential shortcomings and future directions, such as the role of non-invasive brain stimulation to enhance plasticity mechanisms.
