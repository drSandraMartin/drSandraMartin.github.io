abstract: In everyday communication, humans predict
  upcoming language seemingly effortlessly. However, it remains unclear to what extent
  the formation of such predictions taxes executive resources. Our study set out to
  investigate how a limitation of executive resources impacts natural language prediction
  on multiple timescales in a novel dual-task paradigm, and how this impact is modulated
  by age. Participants (N = 175; 18--85 years) read short newspaper articles, presented
  word by word in varying font colours. This self-paced reading task was either performed
  in isolation or paired with a competing n-back task (1-back or 2-back) on the words'
  font colour. We measured word-level reading time and block-level reading comprehension
  as well as n-back performance. To quantify word predictability, we estimated word surprisal on four distinct timescales (i.e., context lengths ranging
  from words to paragraphs) using a large language model. Under high cognitive load,
  adults aged 60 and over benefited most from high word predictability. Our results
  show that independent of timescale, higher cognitive load diminishes the benefits
  of high word predictability on reading time, suggesting language predictions draw
  on executive resources.
